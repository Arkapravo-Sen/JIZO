Problem Statement:
Children under the age of 15 face the risk of heat-related accidents when left unattended in vehicles, leading to preventable fatalities.

Rationale:
Heat-related deaths in cars can be averted with timely intervention. This highlights the need for an affordable solution.

Importance:
The proposed IoT-based child safety system aims to save lives by offering a cost-effective solution to prevent heat-related accidents in vehicles, focusing on the vulnerable group of children under 15.

Proposal:
Develop an IoT-based child safety system utilizing a Raspberry Pi, sensors, and a 4G dongle to monitor and regulate temperature in cars. The system will send real-time alerts to parents or guardians, providing a proactive solution to the issue of leaving children unattended in vehicles.

Research Question:
Can an IoT-based child safety system effectively prevent heat-related car accidents for children under 15?

Goal:
The primary goal is to design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an affordable IoT-based child safety system to reduce heat-related accidents in cars.

Hypothesis:
An IoT-based device can alert caregivers of an unattended child given that it has an internet connection, and if the situation is dire, help save the child.

Device Development:
Construct the IoT-based child safety system using Raspberry Pi, sensors, 4G dongle and USB fan.

Testing:
Conduct controlled experiments to evaluate the accuracy and responsiveness of the system in detecting unattended children and regulating the car's temperature.

Real-world Testing:
Implement the device in real-world scenarios to assess its performance in varied conditions.

Data Collection:
Gather data on accuracy of sensors and effectiveness of program.

Data Analysis:
Collect performance information for each element.
	
	State of car: Does the device detect the state of the car (on or off) accurately? As this step is critical to the performance of the device, it must get a perfect score.


	Person Detection: Does the device detect people well ? This step is also very important as alongside the noise detection, this metric will be used to determine if we send alerts or not.


	Noise Detection: This step is of equal importance to the Person Detection, if the camera is unable to determine if a person is in the space, the mic will provide an additional level of security minimizing potentially deadly errors.


Temperature and humidity detection: This step will only be activated if the car is off, and a person is detected. This will tell the device the temperature of the car so that it may be controlled.


Email/SMS Sending Capability:
Evaluate the device's ability to send alerts after achieving the desired outcome.

Ethical Considerations:
Adhere to ethical standards, prioritizing the safety and well-being of participants.

Data Security:
Implement measures to protect user data and ensure the privacy of individuals involved in the study.
