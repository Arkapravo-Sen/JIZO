# JIZO
An innovative IOT solution utilizing Raspberry Pi and multiple sensors to help you never forget your child in your car again.

## Introduction:

Every year, an average of thirty-eight children under the age of 15 tragically lose their lives due to heat-related accidents in enclosed vehicles. To tackle this issue, our project aims to significantly reduce the number of these fatalities by the use of an innovative IoT-based child safety system, incorporating Raspberry Pi, sensors, and a 4G dongle. The core objective is to alert parents or guardians,  mitigating the risk and consequences of leaving a child unattended in a hot car.

## Purpose:
Develop a device to alert parents of unattended children in cars and prevent temperature rise in vehicles, saving lives and mitigating risks.

## Electronics Needed:
Raspberry Pi 4 2GB RAM, USB Webcam, Temperature and Humidity sensor, USB Fan, ADC (ADS1115), NPN Transistor , 4G USB Dongle, and a Power Bank. The total cost was $92.06.

## Circuit Construction:
The construction of the device involves the attachment of the webcam to the Raspberry Pi. The Humidity and temperature sensor, ADC, and the USB fan will be connected to the Pi using the GPIO pins. The ADC will be interfaced using the I2C bus. And the 4G dongle will enable the ability to send alerts to help save any people who are left unattended.

## Conclusion:
This device not only serves as a proactive reminder but, through monitoring, acts as a safeguard against potential risks. The affordable nature of the solution makes it accessible to a wide range of people.
